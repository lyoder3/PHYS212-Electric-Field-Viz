    "This first cell contains the imports for the python libraries we will be using. The first one is what gives us access to all the 3D objects and animation features. The second is a class which I have developed myself. The third is a 3rd party package that gives us some special data types and allows us to do vector calculations. Below is a brief crash course on object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "By writing `from Charge import Charge` below, python finds the package file named Charge and imports the class within that file named `Charge`. A class is a definition of an object. Objects are code devices which can be assigned names, attributes, and can have things (methods/functions) done to them. For example, you could write a class called `Sandwich` and it might have some attributes like `Sandwich.meat`, `Sandwich.cheese`,`Sandwich.slices_of_cheese`, and `Sandwich.bread`  which you assign the type of meat, cheese type and quantity, and type of bread to. With this idea in mind, creating a sandwich object would look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ham_and_cheese_sandwich = Sandwich(meat='ham', cheese='American', slices_of_cheese = 2, bread='Rye')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note how the words which we assign to attributes are in quotes, typed words like this are strings and must be contained in quotes. Our sandwich object we just created can easily be updated. So say we change our mind and want wheat bread and one slice of cheese, that looks like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ham_and_cheese_sandwich.bread = 'Wheat'\n",
    "ham_and_cheese_sandwich.slices_of_cheese = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, some things you might do with a sandwich would be defined as functions or methods in the class. We may have `take_bite()`, or `cut()`. Each of those methods may have certain arguments which you supply when running it, for example the cut method would have an argument for how many cuts to make and what shape to make them in. Methods can be called like so:\n",
    "```\n",
    "half1, half2 = ham_and_cheese_sandwich.cut(n=1, shape='triangle')\n",
    "half1.take_bite()\n",
    "half2.take_bite()\n",
    "```\n",
    "So we cut our sandwich into two triangles. The cut method has a return that gives us back new objects which correspond to the new cut pieces of our original sandwich. Then we take bites of each of the new pieces, and this doesn't require an equal sign because the method doesn't return anything, it just updates the object itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this we can discuss the `Charge` class. The Charge class has two attributes: `Charge.charge` and `Charge.position`. The `charge` attribute is a positive or negative number representing the charge of the new point charge being created. This number is a float so it can have decimals. The `position` attribute is a VPython vector object which is written as `vector(x,y,z)` where x,y,z are the coordinates of the location. The Charge class has the `efield()` method which calculates the vectorized electric field due to `Charge` at point `r` passed to the method. Some examples of initializing charge objects and what you can do with them are below."

    "In order to understand electric fields, first we need to define what a field is. According to the text, a field in phyics is \"a phyiscal quantity whose value depends on (or is a function of) position, relative to the source of the field.\" An electric field has the units Newtons/Coulomb. With this in mind, and the definition of a field, once can start to make the connection that an electric field is used to figure out electric forces. The field allows you to calculate the force at a given test location, given a configuration of source charges, independent of the charge value of the charge at the test location. Recall Coulomb's Law:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\vec{F} = Q q k{\\Delta\\vec{r} \\over |\\Delta\\vec{r}|^3}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Delta\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_{fp} - \\vec{r}_{s}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "The keyword here is <i>relative</i>, as this position is the difference in the position vectors (aka coordinates), where $\\vec{r}_{s}$ is the position of $q$ and $\\vec{r}_{fp}$ is the position $Q$.\n",
    "The result of this equation is a vector. Recall that the magnitude of a vector can be mathematically represented with the vertical bars i.e., $|\\vec{v}| = \\textbf{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, the above equation will give the vector force on test charge $Q$ due to source charge $q$ based on the two charges relative positions.\n",
    "\n",

    "This can be easily modified for multiple source charges with the following:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This equation represents the vector sum of the forces due to $q_n$ source charges acting on a test charge $q$ at location $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we can derive the equation for the net electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point $\\vec{r}_{fp}$ due to $q_n$ source charges by dividing the equation above by $Q$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = k {\\sum_{i=1}^n {q_i \\over |\\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}|^3}} \\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}\n",

We used `r_0s.append(r_n_x)` to add each of these vectors to the list. In the same loop we do the same exact operation except rotating around the x axis and y axis. This will give us a good amount of starting vectors and allow us to see a full 3D representation of the field lines."
