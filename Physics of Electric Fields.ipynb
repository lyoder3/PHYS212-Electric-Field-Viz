    "In order to understand electric fields, first we need to define what a field is. According to the text, a field in phyics is \"a phyiscal quantity whose value depends on (or is a function of) position, relative to the source of the field.\" An electric field has the units Newtons/Coulomb. With this in mind, and the definition of a field, you can start to make the connection that an electric field is used to figure out electric forces. The field allows you to calculate the force at a given test location, given a configuration of source charges, independent of the value of the charge at the test location. Recall Coulomb's Law:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\vec{F} = Q q k{\\Delta\\vec{r} \\over |\\Delta\\vec{r}|^3}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "Where $Q$ is the test charge, $q$ is the source charge, $k = 9 \\times 10^9$, and the relative position $\\Delta\\vec{r}$ is defined by the following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\Delta\\vec{r} = \\vec{r}_{fp} - \\vec{r}_{s}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "The keyword here is <i>relative</i>, as this position is the difference in the position vectors (aka coordinates), where $\\vec{r}_{s}$ is the position of $q$ and $\\vec{r}_{fp}$ is the position $Q$.\n",
    "The result of this equation is a vector. Recall that the magnitude of a vector can be mathematically represented with the vertical bars i.e., $|\\vec{v}| = \\textbf{v}$\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, the above equation will give the vector force on test charge $Q$ due to source charge $q$ based on the charges' relative positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be easily modified for multiple source charges with the following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\vec{F}(\\vec{r}) = k Q {\\sum_{i=1}^n {q_i \\over |\\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}|^3}} \\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "This equation represents the vector sum of the forces due to $q_n$ source charges acting on a test charge $Q$ at location $\\vec{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, we can derive the equation for the net electric field $\\vec{E}$ at point $\\vec{r}_{fp}$ due to $q_n$ source charges by dividing the equation above by $Q$.\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = k {\\sum_{i=1}^n {q_i \\over |\\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}|^3}} \\Delta\\vec{r}_{i}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the equation we will be using for calculating the net electric field at a test point moving forward. You can find the electric force on any charge $Q$ at the location $\\vec{r}$ by multiplying the result of $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r})$ by $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code block below is an example of this using a basic electric dipole. The first value printed is the vector form of the electric field $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r})$, and the second number is the magnitude of this vector $|\\vec{E}(\\vec{r})|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cells as they are written. Then, adjust the values for the charges and their positions (try two of the same sign with symmetry, try two with different magnitudes and signs, random locations in space, add more than just two charges, etc.). While experimenting with this, you can also adjust the test point location by changing the coordinates inside that vector."
